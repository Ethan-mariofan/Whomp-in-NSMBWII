Ok so this is the first time I am releasing NSMBW custom code but I think this may be benifitial. 

Its the Whomp enemy from SM64, SMG2, and NSMB2   

I haven't tested it with NewerSMBW but I have tested it with NSMBWer+
Get it here: https://github.com/Developers-Collective/NSMBWerPlus

Setup:
Place the Whomp.cpp in Kamek/src
Place the Whomp.yaml in Kamek and in Kamek/processed
add this line to NSMBWerProject.yaml  (WITHOUT THE QUOTS):  "  - processed/Whomp.yaml"

add EN_WHOMP = "the sprite id you want" after "LineGod = 533," recomended to be sprite id 534  (in include/profileid.h)
add EN_WHOMP, after "WM_MANAGER, //803" (in include/profileid.h)

add #define EN_WHOMP PROFILEID_ADJUST_KW+"YOUR PROFILE ID" after #define WM_MANAGER PROFILEID_ADJUST_KW+803 in "include/asm_profiles.S" the profile id is recomended to be 804  

Then follow the NSMBWer+ setup guide in the link to NSMBWer+ to compile the code
