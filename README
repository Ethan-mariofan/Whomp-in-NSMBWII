Ok so this is the first time I am releasing NSMBW custom code but I think this may be benifitial. 

Its the Whomp enemy from SM64, SMG2, and NSMB2   

I haven't tested it with NewerSMBW but I have tested it with NSMBWer+
Get it here: https://github.com/Developers-Collective/NSMBWerPlus

Setup:
Place the Whomp.cpp in Kamek/src
Place the Whomp.yaml in Kamek and in Kamek/processed
add this line to NSMBWerProject.yaml  (WITHOUT THE QUOTS):  "  - processed/Whomp.yaml"
